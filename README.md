# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction-Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. This helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market.

🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction
📁 Repository Contents
bangalore-house-price-prediction.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with end-to-end data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

BHP.csv – Dataset containing historical property listings in Bangalore, India.

📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. This helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market.

🔍 Problem Statement
The Bangalore real estate market has a wide range of properties with significant price variations across locations and features. Manual pricing is inefficient and error-prone. We aim to:

Analyze historical house listings data.

Engineer meaningful features to improve prediction.

Train a machine learning model to estimate price per square foot.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Python	Primary programming language
Pandas	Data manipulation
NumPy	Numerical computations
Matplotlib / Seaborn	Data visualization
Scikit-learn	Model building and evaluation
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive analysis environment

📊 Dataset Overview (BHP.csv)
Location: Name of the area/locality

Size: Number of bedrooms (e.g., 2 BHK, 4 Bedroom)

Total_Sqft: Area of the property in square feet

Bath: Number of bathrooms

Price: Price in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000 INR)

✅ Project Workflow
Data Cleaning

Removal of non-numeric square footage values

Standardization of feature formats

Elimination of outliers using IQR and z-score methods

Feature Engineering

Extracting number of bedrooms (BHK) from size

Converting total square feet to numeric

Reducing high-cardinality location feature using dimensionality reduction techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing price distribution

Relationship between area, BHK, location, and price

Identifying unusual pricing patterns

Modeling

Train-test split

Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree models tested

Best model selected based on R² score and cross-validation

Model Deployment Readiness

Model serialized using pickle

Column transformer saved for production use

🧠 Key Insights
Location has the highest impact on pricing, followed by square footage.

Many outliers found in luxury properties that skew average pricing.

2 BHKs in premium areas can be priced higher than 4 BHKs in outskirts.

💡 Sample Use Case
You can use this project to:

Build a web app for real estate price prediction.

Integrate with property listing platforms.

Support real estate consultancy decisions.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add geolocation data (lat/long) for spatial analysis.

Implement a web interface using Streamlit or Flask.

Include amenities and builder reputation as additional features.
