# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction-Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. This helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market.
